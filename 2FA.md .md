2FA and you:  I personally use it on my gaming accounts such as steam and I actually use it to control my insulin pump as well and that requires 2fa everytime I need insulin

I personally do have 2FA on all of my systems because it requires it these days. With my email It has to verify my phone number and sends a generated code to make sure I am who I say I am.

My personal choice is that 2FA helps neutralizes the risk associated with compromised passwords if a password is phised or hacked. There is still another step that needs to be taken for it to gain access to your account. This just adds another layer of secuirty.
